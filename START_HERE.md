## 💡 My Recommendation

**Go with Firebase** (Option 2 from recovery plan)

**Why?**
- ✅ Best balance of features and simplicity
- ✅ Free tier is generous (perfect for your app)
- ✅ 2-3 hours to complete recovery
- ✅ Includes hosting (one-stop solution)
- ✅ Real-time sync works great for meal planning
- ✅ Easy to scale if you want to share publicly

**What I'll Do:**
1. Set up Firebase project
2. Create API wrapper
3. Update all database calls
4. Seed food database
5. Test everything
6. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
7. Give you the live URL

**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Cost**: $0 (free tier)  
**Result**: Fully functional cloud-based app
